# PROG-ROBOT-MAZE

### This project was done for the subject of PROG in FEUP. Grade = 86%.

This is a little game that runs on the terminal done for  programming class.
This is very simple. but was really enjoyable to do.

The goal is to escape the maze without getting caught by thue robots, you can just compile and run it anywhere.
Have fun!
