PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT STATE:

we created a file for the title screen (also the main menu), and ine for the rules. Both of them have alternate simpler screen using cout if those files are not found (TITLE.TXT and/or RULES.TXT)
Addicionally we made an opition to see a file with the time records from the main menu by typing "3".
All the inputs have "control + z" added into them and if the inout is not vald it will prompt the user to type a new input.
after every game the player is asked if he wishes tomplay again, if the answer is positive the main menu will be opened again.
If the player completed the maze and won, he will be given his time and asked if we wants to save his time. if so the maze_winner file will be changed
otherwise it will not be changed. After that he will be asked if he wants to exit or go to the main menu.

MAIN DIFFICULTIES:

 Adicionar depois
 
 -At first it was hard to find the position of the robots, or to manage all the robots
 -To think a way to pass the map, player and robots information necessary for the rounds to take place
 -if the maze_winner file already existed we had difficult recording a new time. This includes a new time all together or altering an existing player.
